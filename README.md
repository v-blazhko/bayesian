Classifying set of Cifar-10 pictures with algorythm based on calculation of Bayesian probabilities with Python

Firstly, we check if random classification works fine: it should be ~10% of accuracy (according to the number of classes we have. For CIFAR-10 dataset it's 10).
Then a Bayesian classifier and the full multivariate normal distribution Bayesian classifier are implemented.
Also dividing picture into certain amount of blocks is tested.

Accuracy results are presented in a graph.
